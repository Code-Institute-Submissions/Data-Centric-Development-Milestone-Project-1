StoryBoard Data-Centric Development Project:
=

The purpose of this project is to allow a user to interact with a database using the four basic CRUD functions (Create,
Read, Update, Delete). This database is structured around creating and editing a narrative, be it a more general
worldbuilding exercise, or a more specific story.

This project is designed for people who are writing or planning to write a story, and wish to organise and view their
data, as well as be able to search the data, and to delete, edit or add to the data in question. Navigation is designed
to be as simple as possible, by having a search bar and nesting relevant subcategories on the 'Categories' page (e.g:
'House' and 'City' may show up under the 'Place' section of the 'Categories' page).

Deployment:
-

This project is deployed to GitHub pages, and can be viewed in its rendered form in Heroku [here](https://story-database-milestone.herokuapp.com/). 
It can also be viewed in its code form in github [here](https://github.com/Felix-Redwood/Data-Centric-Development-Milestone-Project).

I have taken steps to ensure that after every session with the development version of this project, I push my code to both Github and Heroku.
Currently there is no difference between the deployed version of this project and the development version.
